# test_files

I implemented a mySet data type in the test.js file and did a basic javascript form-processing 
index.html page using the mySet data structure. Button clicks and editing input text processes 
the document form and populates the log text label.

My initial assumptions:
- this Set implementation should not use JavascriptÂ  standard built-in Set object;
- this Set implementation should use Javascript Array as internal data storage and use some of
the Array functions (length, indexOf, splice);
- this Set implementation should implement mathematical Set operations such as:
    - add, 
    - remove, 
    - contains, 
    - size, 
    - equals, 
    - union, 
    - difference, 
    - symmetric difference, 
    - subset, 
    - superset;
- index.html is allowing user to perform some set operations through input text field, button 
clicks and span labels;
- index.html was tested in Google Chrome, Firefox and Safari;
- index.html is not the only possible way of testing the code, for now I assumed that it gives 
a basic understanding of Set functionality available.
